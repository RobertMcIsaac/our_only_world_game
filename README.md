# 🌊 Game Jam X OUR ONLY WORLD
An educational game that teaches children about keeping our oceans healthy 🐢♻️


## 📝 About the Game
This is a fun, interactive game designed to teach primary school children about the health of our oceans. Players must decide whether an item belongs in the ocean or not by clicking ✅ (tick) or ❌ (cross).

Every correct or incorrect choice is followed by a fact about the item, helping players learn about marine life and environmental issues.

This game was built during a one-day Game Jam event in collaboration with OUR ONLY WORLD, a charity focused on ocean health.


## 🎮 How to Play
Look at the item that appears in the center of the screen.  
Decide whether it belongs in the ocean:  

Click ✅ if it belongs in the ocean (e.g., fish, seaweed).  

Click ❌ if it shouldn’t be in the ocean (e.g., plastic bags, coffee cups).  

After selecting, you’ll see a fact about the item.  

Click anywhere to move to the next item.  

Keep playing and learning! 🌊🐠
