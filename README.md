🌊 Ocean Cleanup Game
An educational game to teach kids about ocean pollution! 🐢♻️


📝 About the Game
This is a fun, interactive game designed to teach children about ocean conservation and pollution. Players must decide whether an item belongs in the ocean or not by clicking ✅ (tick) or ❌ (cross).

Every correct or incorrect choice is followed by a fact about the item, helping players learn about marine life and environmental issues.

This game was built during a one-day Game Jam event in collaboration with OUR ONLY WORLD, a charity focused on ocean health.


🎮 How to Play
Look at the item that appears in the center of the screen.
Decide whether it belongs in the ocean:
Click ✅ if it belongs in the ocean (e.g., fish, seaweed).
Click ❌ if it shouldn’t be in the ocean (e.g., plastic bags, coffee cups).
After selecting, you’ll see a fact about the item.
Click anywhere to move to the next item.
Keep playing and learning! 🌊🐠
